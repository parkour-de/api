    <h1>Deutscher Parkour Verband API</h1>
    <p><a href="./demo/captcha.htm">Open Captcha Demo</a></p>
    <p>The Deutscher Parkour Verband API is a web service that provides access to information related to parkour training sessions, locations, associations, members, users and more. It's designed to be a part of the infrastructure for managing and organizing parkour activities within the German Parkour Association.</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of this API is to serve as the backend for a comprehensive platform for parkour enthusiasts, trainers, and organizers. It allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retrieve information about upcoming training sessions.</li>
        <li>Find parkour training locations in their area.</li>
        <li>Register and manage user profiles.</li>
        <li>Organize and schedule training sessions and events.</li>
        <li>Sort, filter, comment and share information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>This API comes with a variety of features, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Training Sessions:</strong> Information about upcoming training sessions, including date, time, location, and organizers.</li>
        <li><strong>Locations:</strong> A database of parkour training locations, complete with details on facilities and accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Scheduling:</strong> Organizers can create and schedule training sessions, workshops, and events.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth Integration:</strong> Support for OAuth authentication, allowing users to log in with their preferred social media accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deployment</h2>
    <p>This project is set up for Google Cloud Build, as it can build,test the Golang application and push the resulting Docker image to Google Container Registry.</p>
    <h2>Local Testing</h2>
    <p>To build and test the application locally, run the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>make build</code></pre>
    <p>This will compile the application and run the unit tests. To run the application locally, use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>make run</code></pre>
    <p>This will start the HTTP server at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to run the application inside a Docker container, you can use the following command instead:</p>
    <pre><code>make docker-build docker-run</code></pre>
    <p>This will build a Docker image and start a container that runs the application. The HTTP server will be available at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.</p>
    <h2>Google Cloud Build</h2>
    <p>To build and push the Docker image to Google Container Registry using Cloud Build, use the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml .</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file contains the build steps for the Cloud Build process. The steps include downloading Go modules, running unit tests, building the application, building the Docker image, and pushing the image to Google Container Registry.</p>
    <p>In order to optimize the build process and make the resulting Docker image as small and performant as possible, we use <code>golang:1.21-alpine</code> as the builder image and <code>alpine:latest</code> as the final Docker image. The builder image includes the necessary tools to build and test the application, while the final image is based on Alpine Linux, which is a lightweight Linux distribution that is optimized for containerized environments.</p>
    <p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> contains everything needed to run tests within Docker and build the image. However, when we use Cloud Build, the testing and building of the binary happens within <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code>. Therefore, the <code>Dockerfile-cloudbuild</code> is only responsible for creating the image by copying the binary into it. By separating the build and image creation steps in this way, we can optimize the build process and make it visible in the UI.</p>
    <h2>Setting up ArangoDB</h2>
    <pre><code>docker run -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=change-me -v /Users/changeme/path/to/dpv-db:/var/lib/arangodb3 arangodb/arangodb:latest</code></pre>
    <h2>API documentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Validate RAML files and generate HTML documentation:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>    npm i -g raml2html
    raml2html -v -i docs/api.raml -o docs/api.html</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Build OpenAPI 3.0 specification from RAML:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>    npm i -g oas-raml-converter-cli
    oas-raml-converter-cli
    Choose the converter 4) RAML 1.0 &gt; OAS 3.0: 4
    Enter the source path of the file: docs/api.raml
    Enter the destination path for the file: docs/api.json
    Are you sure you want to continue (y/n): y</code></pre>
